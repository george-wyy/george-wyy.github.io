excerpt: '该论文研究了SSVEP-BCI系统在脑机接口领域的应用。该系统具有少量记录电极、短训练时间和强大的抗干扰能力等优点。然而，该系统的缺点是识别效率较低，并且刺激界面容易引起用户的视觉疲劳。因此，本文针对SSVEP-BCI界面中刺激元素的优化进行了研究，探讨了在相同刺激区域下不同数量辅助刺激颗粒对系统识别效率和用户体验的影响。进行了相关的人体工效学实验和主观评价。人体工效学实验结果表明，辅助刺激颗粒的数量对系统识别效率有显著影响，当辅助刺激颗粒数量趋近于无穷大时，识别效率最高。主观评价结果显示，辅助刺激颗粒数量的变化对系统界面可用性指标得分有显著影响，数量无限时得分较高。从设计人体工效学的角度出发，本研究探讨了辅助刺激颗粒数量对脑机接口系统效率和用户满意度的影响，研究结论对优化和规范脑机接口设计具有重要的指导意义。'

SSVEP-BCI system has the advantages of few recording electrodes, short training time, strong anti-interference ability, etc. It is widely used in the brain-computer interface (BCI) field. However, this system also has the disadvantage of low recognition efficiency. Its stimulation interface will also cause visual fatigue for the users. Therefore, aiming at the optimization of stimulus elements in the SSVEP-BCI interface, this paper explored the impact of different numbers of auxiliary stimulus particles on the system recognition efficiency and user experience under the same stimulus area. Relevant ergonomic experiments and subjective evaluations were conducted. Ergonomic experiment results show that the number of auxiliary stimulus particles has a significant impact on the recognition efficiency of the system. When the number of auxiliary stimulus particles approaches infinity, the recognition efficiency is the highest. The subjective evaluation results show that the change in the number of auxiliary stimulus particles has a significant impact on the system interface usability index score, and the score is higher when the number is infinite. From the perspective of design ergonomics, this study explored the impact of the number of auxiliary stimulus particles on the efficiency of the brain-computer interface system and user satisfaction, the research conclusions have important guiding significance for optimizing and standardizing the design of the brain-computer interface.
